# Head Injury – NICE NG232 (Imaging Guidance)

**Source:** NICE guideline NG232 – *Head injury: assessment and early management* (May 2023) :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

> This page summarises the NICE criteria for selecting head injury patients for CT head ± CT cervical spine imaging. It is based on the 2023 update and focuses on imaging indications and timing. Always follow local trauma protocols and clinical judgement.

---

## Adult Imaging Criteria (>= 16 years)

### **Immediate CT Head (within 1 hour)**  
Do **urgent** CT head if ANY of the following are present:

- Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) **≤ 12** on initial assessment  
- GCS **< 15 at 2 hours** after injury  
- **Suspected open or depressed skull fracture**  
- **Post-traumatic seizure**  
- **Focal neurological deficit**  
- **More than one episode of vomiting**  
- *Consider cervical spine imaging alongside head imaging if risk factors present* :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

### **CT Head within 8 hours**  
If the patient has had **some loss of consciousness or amnesia**, perform a CT head within 8 hours *and* sooner (within 1 hour) if they present >8 hours after injury AND have any of:

- **Age 65 years or older**  
- **Current bleeding or clotting disorder**  
- **Dangerous mechanism of injury** (e.g., pedestrian hit by vehicle, fall >1 m or >5 stairs)  
- **Retrograde amnesia > 30 min** :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### **Anticoagulant / Antiplatelet Considerations**
NICE does **not mandate automatic CT** for all anticoagulated patients without other indications. Shared decision-making may guide imaging if no other risk factors. Antiplatelet therapy (excluding aspirin alone) may be considered similar to anticoagulation. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

## Paediatric Imaging Criteria (< 16 years)

### **Blood Imaging (CT Head)**

#### **Urgent CT (within 1 hour)** if ANY of:

- **Suspicion of non-accidental injury**  
- **Post-traumatic seizure**  
- GCS score less than age-appropriate thresholds (e.g., <14 in children; <15 in babies under 1)  
- GCS <15 at 2 hours after injury  
- **Suspected depressed skull fracture or tense fontanelle** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

#### **Multiple Risk Factors**
If more than one of the following are present, perform CT within 1 hour:

- **Loss of consciousness > 5 min** (witnessed)  
- **Abnormal drowsiness**  
- **3+ episodes of vomiting**  
- **Dangerous mechanism**  
- **Amnesia (anterograde or retrograde)**  
- **Current bleeding/clotting disorder** :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

> **Observation Strategy:** If only a single minor risk factor exists, observe for a minimum of 4 hours with serial assessment; proceed to CT if deterioration or additional risk factors arise. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

## Cervical Spine Imaging (CT C-Spine)

Perform CT C-spine **within 1 hour** if ANY high-risk features:

- GCS ≤ 12 at initial assessment  
- **Intubated** patient requiring definitive spine clearance  
- **Strong clinical suspicion of C-spine injury** despite normal X-rays  
- Other body areas being scanned (e.g., pan-CT) with suspicion of C-spine injuries  
- **X-rays technically inadequate** or unreliable clinical clearance :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## General Principles

- Do **not use skull X-rays** to diagnose intracranial injury or replace CT head. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}  
- **MRI should not be the primary test** for acute head injury. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}  
- Observation and **clinical reassessment** are critical if CT is not performed. :contentReference[oaicite:10]{index=10}

---

## Discharge and Safety Netting

Provide written and verbal advice on:

- Nature and severity of head injury  
- Symptoms that should prompt return to hospital  
- Who should supervise the patient for the first 24 hours  
- Activity advice (work, sports, driving)  
- Contact details for delayed complications :contentReference[oaicite:11]{index=11}

---

## Key Definitions (from NG232)

- **High-energy mechanism:** e.g., pedestrian/cyclist hit by a vehicle, fall from height >1 m or >5 stairs, high-speed RTC. :contentReference[oaicite:12]{index=12}  
- **Dangerous mechanism:** as above; consider for adult and paediatric decision rules. :contentReference[oaicite:13]{index=13}
