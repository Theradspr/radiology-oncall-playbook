## Overview

Cauda Equina Syndrome (CES) is a **surgical emergency** caused by acute compression of the cauda equina nerves.  
Delayed diagnosis or treatment can result in **permanent bowel/bladder dysfunction, sexual dysfunction, lower limb weakness or paralysis**.  
Prompt imaging and referral are crucial for good outcomes. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

## When to Suspect CES

Suspect CES in patients with **back pain and/or sciatica** plus ANY of the following **new or worsening** symptoms (symptom onset within 14 days or deteriorating):

- **Difficulty initiating urination** or impaired sensation of urinary flow  
- **Altered perianal, perineal or genital sensation** (e.g., saddle anaesthesia or paraesthesia)  
- **Severe or progressive lower limb neurological deficit**  
  (e.g., weakness of knee extension/ankle dorsiflexion)  
- **Loss of sensation of rectal fullness**  
- **Sexual dysfunction**  
*Note:* Not all features must be present. Absence of red flags does NOT exclude CES if symptoms are evolving. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## Triage & Referral

### 1. **Emergency Referral**

Refer the patient **immediately** to the **nearest hospital with emergency MRI provision** if CIS symptoms are present.  
Referral may be made after telephone review if in-person delays would worsen outcome.  
Document clearly:  
- Timing and progression of symptoms  
- Physical exam findings (power, sensation, reflexes)  
- Red flag features and urgency status  
- Whether symptoms are static or progressive :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

### 2. **Urgent MSK Triage Referral**

If symptoms suggest possible CES but do not meet emergency criteria (e.g., bilateral leg pain without red flags), refer urgently (to be seen within two weeks) to MSK triage/urgent care with clear instructions to escalate if symptoms worsen. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

---

## Role of Imaging

### **MRI Spine is the Primary Diagnostic Test**

- Perform **emergency MRI at presenting hospital** for suspected CES.  
- MRI should be done **as soon as possible** and **definitely within 4 hours** of the request.  
- Local systems must enable **24/7 emergency MRI provision** by June 2024 or equivalent local arrangements. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

#### MRI Protocol
- A **sagittal T2-weighted sequence** is the core screening sequence for cauda equina compression.  
- If compression is found: add **axial T2** and **sagittal/axial T1** imaging for surgical planning.  
- If no compression, consider extended sagittal survey including thoracic/cervical spine to exclude other pathology. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

---

## Bladder Scanning (Adjunct)

Bladder scanning **should NOT be used in isolation** to diagnose/exclude CES, but it can aid assessment:

- Post-void residual (PVR) < 200 mL does **not** exclude CES  
- PVR > 200 mL increases likelihood  
- PVR > 600 mL + inability to void → catheterise  
Use findings in context with clinical suspicion and proceed to MRI regardless if CES symptoms persist. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

---

## Radiology Workflow & Practical Points

- **Do not delay MRI for approval** from surgical teams — imaging should be prioritised.  
- Keep patients **nil by mouth** before emergency imaging and potential surgery.  
- Emergency MRI must take precedence over routine imaging schedules.  
- **If MRI is unsafe/unavailable**, CT ± CT myelogram can be used as a contingency.  
- Provide quick access to images for surgical teams via PACS/network pathways.  
- Ensure radiology services define responsibility for 24/7 reporting/triage. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}

---

## Post-Imaging Actions

- **Compression confirmed on MRI** → immediate referral to spinal surgical team  
  - Maintain nil by mouth  
  - Arrange transfer and pre-op preparations  
- **No compression on MRI but neural irritation present**  
  → safety-net with advice on symptom progression and MSK triage referral  
- **No cause found** → consider alternative diagnoses/referral pathways

---

## Documentation & Safety Netting

- Record timing of referral, clinical findings, imaging results, and rationale for decisions.  
- Provide patients with clear safety-net instructions for symptom escalation.  
- Use standardised pathways/proformas to improve clarity and reduce delays. :contentReference[oaicite:8]{index=8}

---

## Summary – Key Takeaways

- CES is a **time-critical neurosurgical emergency.**  
- **Emergency MRI within 4 hours** is the diagnostic standard when CES is suspected.  
- Clinical symptoms are variable — rely on red flags and clinical progression.  
- Urgent referral and imaging override non-urgent imaging workflows.  
- Bladder scanning is a useful adjunct but cannot replace MRI. :contentReference[oaicite:9]{index=9}
