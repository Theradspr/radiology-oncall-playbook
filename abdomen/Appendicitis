This page summarises recommendations for assessment and investigations in people with suspected appendicitis.

---

## Initial Assessment

### Clinical Features

Consider appendicitis in people presenting with:

- Abdominal pain (especially peri-umbilical migrating to right lower quadrant)  
- Anorexia  
- Nausea or vomiting  
- Low-grade fever  
- Localised tenderness in right iliac fossa  
- Rebound tenderness, guarding or rigidity may develop

Note: Presentation may be atypical, especially in:

- Older adults  
- Children  
- Pregnant people  
- People with high BMI

---

## Early Observations and Initial Tests

Assess and monitor:

- Vital signs (temperature, pulse, blood pressure)  
- Abdominal examination  
- Urinalysis (to exclude urinary causes)

Consider baseline blood tests (where available):

- Full blood count  
- C-reactive protein (CRP)  
- Serum electrolytes and renal profile

---

## Risk Stratification

Use clinical scoring systems (e.g., **Alvarado score**, **Adult Appendicitis Score**) to support clinical judgement, but do not **rely solely** on scores to make decisions.

Scores may help determine urgency of imaging.

## Imaging in Suspected Appendicitis

### Children and Young People

- **Ultrasound** is the first-line imaging modality where available and practicable.  
- If ultrasound is non-diagnostic and clinical suspicion remains high, consider **MRI** (in centres with capacity) or **CT** (with appropriate dose optimisation).

### Adults

- Offer **CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis** when appendicitis is suspected and the diagnosis is uncertain after clinical assessment.  
- Consider **low-dose CT protocols** where available and appropriate.  
- **Ultrasound** may be used initially if readily available and sufficient expertise exists, especially in:

  - Younger adults  
  - Women of childbearing age (to help exclude gynaecological pathology)

### Pregnant People

- Use **ultrasound** first as it avoids radiation.  
- If ultrasound is **non-diagnostic** and suspicion remains, consider **MRI** (if available).  
- If MRI is unavailable or inconclusive, consider **CT** after specialist discussion (balancing risk and clinical urgency).

---

## Interpretation & Next Steps

- **Positive imaging** consistent with appendicitis → arrange surgical/definitive management.  
- **Non-diagnostic imaging** but persistent clinical concern → admit, observe and repeat imaging as appropriate.  
- **Alternative diagnosis** identified on imaging → manage accordingly or refer specialist as needed.

---

## Timing of Imaging

- Imaging should not delay definitive management where clinical features strongly indicate complicated appendicitis (e.g., peritonitis, sepsis).  
- In cases of diagnostic uncertainty, prompt imaging can reduce negative explorations and support appropriate pathways.

---

## Admission and Observation

Consider **admission for observation** if:

- Diagnosis remains uncertain after initial assessment and initial imaging  
- Symptoms are persistent or worsening  
- Vital signs unstable  
- Pain control challenging

---

## Surgical & Specialist Referral

- Refer to **surgical team** (general surgery or acute surgery) early when:

  - Imaging confirms appendicitis  
  - Clinical condition suggests complicated appendicitis  
  - Symptoms are severe or deteriorating

- Shared decision-making with patient about options including:

  - Operative management (appendicectomy)  
  - Non-operative management (in selected cases)

---

## Pain Relief

Provide **analgesia** appropriate to symptom severity, balancing diagnostic clarity vs patient comfort.

---

## Summary – Key Actions for Suspected Appendicitis

- Perform detailed history and examination.  
- Use scoring systems to assist, not replace, clinical judgement.  
- Choose imaging based on age, pregnancy status and diagnostic uncertainty:  
  - **Children:** ultrasound → MRI/CT if needed  
  - **Adults:** CT (standard/low-dose) ± ultrasound  
  - **Pregnancy:** ultrasound → MRI → CT (if needed)  
- Avoid delays in imaging where diagnosis is unclear.  
- Refer to surgery early when indicated.
